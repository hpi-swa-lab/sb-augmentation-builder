## editing essentials

- [ ] shift-tab
- [ ] do not indent after newline when {
- [ ] typeover detection: wrap {} with {
- [ ] proceed with save, even if formatting fails (but notify)
- [ ] editor.selectionRange in the presence of a watch
- [ ] shard focus and caret movement
- [ ] don't error on malformed replacement source
- [ ] clear search field when refocusing

## lower priority

- [ ] unify global shortcut system
- [ ] jsx replacements
- [ ] lsp hover

## diffing

- [ ] `[1, 2, 3] --> [1, 2, 3,]` causes complete unload/load
- [ ] stickiness

## paper
- [ ] todo steps / table aufschreiben
- [ ] matrix with use cases, is it fulfilled? in text and in sb
- [ ] will replacements stay alive across edit operations?
		* performance?
		*	editing replay benchmarks
- [ ] can replacements block edits? (should be visible through a block in a replacement)
		* read-only areas in a text editor (using the example of a game)
